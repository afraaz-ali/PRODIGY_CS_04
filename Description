Simple Keylogger for Educational Purposes

This Python program demonstrates a basic keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes made on a system. 
The program uses the pynput library to listen to keyboard events and saves the captured keystrokes into a text file.

Features:

Global Keylogging: The program captures keystrokes system-wide, across all applications (not limited to a single app).
Logs Special Keys: In addition to regular characters, it also logs special keys like space, enter, and function keys.
Log File Output: Keystrokes are saved to a text file (key_log.txt) in the current directory.
Stop Logging with Esc Key: The keylogger can be stopped by pressing the Esc key.

Educational Use Only:
This program is intended for educational purposes, to understand how keyloggers work and how to safeguard against them. 
Do not use this program for any malicious or illegal purposes. Always ensure you have explicit consent from any users before running the program on their systems.
